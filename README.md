# Versioning Strategy

Version Number Format: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

[Refer Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)

## Git-Flow Branching

- master 
- develop
- feature/*
- bugfix/*
- release/*

## Versioning Tasks

- snapshot : Generates the snapshots
- candidate : Generates the release candidates
- final : Generates the final version

## A small versioning story

Once upon a time there was an app called ver-demo. The whole code just stayed in just one master branch and thats it.

![](https://www.crystalknows.com/assets/home2/headshots/Jim-caa44f228cddc4390264363960c74bb0996438231a2dc3954b8b9d1da60bb080.png "Jim") Jim Halpert joins the team. Unlike others, he wants to do everything smart. He prints the [git-flow diagram](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/images/gitflow.gif) and pin it on his desk. And the rest of the story follows..

### Sets up

Day 1) First, he created `develop` branch from `master`

`git checkout -b develop`

He didn't do anything that day, but simply plugged in the develop branch to daily build with generated snapshots.

`gradle clean build sonarqube snapshot publish`

This created version `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`. (Remember: No tags are created on snapshots)

artifact was generated - `ver-demo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Jim knew every day, this would create artifacts under `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` folder in the artifactory maven-snapshots repository as
`name-version-YYYYMMDD.HHmmSS.#.jar`

```
maven-snapshots
    com/dunder-mifflin/hello
        0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
            ver-demo-0.1.0-20170622.154848-1.jar
            ver-demo-0.1.0-20170622.154848-2.jar
```

### Build something

Day 2) ![](https://www.crystalknows.com/assets/home2/headshots/Michael-bd9d503d1aba60c023818beaa5f6b7c27a4d9fa7f300ce2291a7f5caaa39dc6d.png "Michael Scott") Michael asks him to build something instead of chatting at reception desk.  

Jim goes to his desk and creates feature branch (`feature/build-smthng`) from `develop` 

`git checkout -b feature/build-smthng`

He then runs `gradle clean build` and notice the version number it generated `0.1.0-dev.3-build.smthng.cafb6a9`

> It told him 3 commits in develop from the last release and it had his branch name and last commit# too

He changes `System.out.println("Hello.. Its Dunder Mifflin");` to `System.out.println("Hello.. Dwgiht is the worst!")` in Hello.java;

He runs `gradle clean build` again and noticed the change in version number : `0.1.0-dev.3.uncommitted-build.smthng.cafb6a9`

When he ran the app, it printed "Hello.. Dwgiht is the worst!". 

Checked the code in  `git add. && git commit -m "greatest" && git push` and ran `gradle clean build` command again just for fun and saw the version number changed to `0.1.0-dev.4-build.smthng.d40eaf0`

> 4 commits in develop in this SNAPSHOT version; the last commit is Jim's
 
It was time to merge his feature to develop. So he did..
```
git checkout develop
git merge feature/build-smthng
```
... and left for the day.

Daily build ran on develop and created a new SNAPSHOT version with Jim's changes

```
maven-snapshots
    com/dunder-mifflin/hello
        0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
            ver-demo-0.1.0-20170622.154848-1.jar
            ver-demo-0.1.0-20170622.154848-2.jar
            ver-demo-0.1.0-20170622.160800-3.jar  <== Jim's changes here
```

### Ready for Release (Candidate)

Day 3) Jim wants to push his change to production. So he goes on and creates a release branch.

Jim creates release branch (`release/0.x`) 

`git checkout -b release/0.x`

He is still not sure if this is the final release version. So he creates a release-candidate (RC)

`gradle candidate publish`

This created version `0.1.0-rc.1` 

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc.#
[# is the number of release candidates for this version produced so far]
```

and jar got uploaded to maven-releases repo in artifactory (publish)

```
maven-releases
    com/dunder-mifflin/hello
        0.1.0-rc.1
            ver-demo-0.1.0-rc.1.jar
```
---

![](http://sdfoodmenu.com/wp-content/plugins/full-screen-morphing-search/assets/img/tag.png) **He notices that the git repository has now a tag created (`v0.1.0-rc.1`)** 

---

### Oops..Bugs

He is all set to push it to prod but wants to show to Pam once ![](https://www.crystalknows.com/assets/home2/headshots/Pam-ea5183b13d746d55da41e268323ac7e5c78cb4b994dddab715043cb2fe5cedc5.png "Pam"). 

> "OOps" says Pam.. "Jim, Dwight's name is spelled wrong". 

Jim is frustrated but he is determined to fix it and push the release today itself.

Jim creates a bugfix branch from `release/0.x`-> `bugfix/j-123`

`git checkout -b bugfix/crap-spell`

He corrects "Dwgiht" to "Dwight" in Hello.java

Builds it `gradle clean build`

version# -  `0.1.0-rc.1.dev.0.uncommitted-d40eaf0`

He commits the changes and runs the build:

```
git add && git commit -m "spell fix" && git push && gradle clean build`
```

This time the version# is `0.1.0-rc.1.dev.1-20aadcb`

### Merge the fix back

Jim merges `bugfix/crap-spell` branch to `release/0.x`

```
git checkout release/0.x
git merge bugfix/crap-spell
```

He creates a new release candidate

`gradle candidate publish`

new RC version `0.1.0-rc.2`  got generated and jar got uploaded to maven-releases repo in artifactory (publish)

```
maven-releases
    com/dunder-mifflin/hello
        0.1.0-rc.1
            ver-demo-0.1.0-rc.1.jar
        0.1.0-rc.2
            ver-demo-0.1.0-rc.2.jar  <== Release candidate 2 (fix for spell error)
```

---

 ![](http://sdfoodmenu.com/wp-content/plugins/full-screen-morphing-search/assets/img/tag.png) **He notices that the git repository has now a tag created (`v0.1.0-rc.2`)**

---

> "Pam, check it out now.." 
 
Pam verifies and gives him thumbs up. "Looking good Jim" ![](https://www.crystalknows.com/assets/home2/headshots/Pam-ea5183b13d746d55da41e268323ac7e5c78cb4b994dddab715043cb2fe5cedc5.png "Pam approves")

### Released (finally)

Jim makes the release final

`gradle final publish` 

That creates the version `0.1.0` and uploads the jar to artifactory

```
maven-releases
    com/dunder-mifflin/hello
        0.1.0
            ver-demo-0.1.0.jar          <=== RELEASE JAR
        0.1.0-rc.1
            ver-demo-0.1.0-rc.1.jar
        0.1.0-rc.2
            ver-demo-0.1.0-rc.2.jar
```


---

 ![](http://sdfoodmenu.com/wp-content/plugins/full-screen-morphing-search/assets/img/tag.png) **He notices that the git repository has now a tag created (`v0.1.0`)**

---

He proceeds with the deployment and Dundler mifflin Hello app now says "Hello...Dwight is the worst!"

### Merge

As a responsible guy, Jim syncs up the changes to both master and develop branches

```
git checkout master
git merge release/0.x
git checkout develop
git merge release/0.x
```

Next day, Dwight was in for a major surpise when he started Hello app.

![](https://68.media.tumblr.com/avatar_8899e6fae769_128.png) _"Hello...Dwight is the worst!"_

### Now, Dwight wants to prank..

![](https://www.crystalknows.com/assets/home2/headshots/Dwight-b6d045bbfa5b7b2bdf9be9253951ac0b2d73751eb44089cf5c30592f1447db93.png "Dwight") Dwight decides to change "Dwight is the worst" to  "_____" (a real solid prank. shhh..)

He creates a new feature branch

```
git checkout -b feature/kill-jim
```

Does a build `gradle clean build`

version # shows up as `0.2.0-dev.0-develop.20aadcb`

---

He notices the version number has been automatically upgraded to **0.2.0 as 0.1.0 has already been released. Anything from now on is > 0.1.0**

---

The story continues.. (but hope you got the point)

## Keep in mind

The tasks:

- snapshot : Generates the snapshots but doesn't create tag in repository
- candidate : Generates the release candidates and creates tag in repository (v$ver-rc.#)
- final : Generates the final version and creates tag in repository (v$ver)

Typically,

- `snapshot` is done on `develop` branch
- `candidate` and `final` are done on `release` branches
    + can be done on `bugfix` branch for hotfixes
- on release/1.x branch, after every release, the version number increases as v1._x+1_.0
- on release/2.1.x branch, after every release, the version number increases as v2.1._x+1_
- major, minor or patch numbers can be bumped up manually also 
    - (gradle plugin does it this way `gradle <snapshot|candidate|release> -Prelease.scope=<major|minor|patch>`)

---

Version# bump:

- on release/1.x branch, after every release, the version number increases as v1._x+1_.0
- on release/32.1.x branch, after every release, the version number increases as v32.1._x+1_
- major, minor or patch numbers can be bumped up manually also 
    - (gradle release plugin <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> does it this way `gradle <snapshot|candidate|release> -Prelease.scope=<major|minor|patch>` )
